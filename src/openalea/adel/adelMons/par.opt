# the number of plant optical species
n 2
# s stands for soil reflectance, d stands for diffuse and is the only option at this time.
# This line must be included even if there is no soil in the L-system nor in the simulation.
s d 0.17
# e stands for species. in this case just 1. therfore one line of data
# d has the same meaning as for soil.
# the first number is stem reflectance
# second and third are reflectance and transmittance of upper side
# fourth and fifth are reflectance and transmittance of lower side
#  this is not singular i.e. this combination of values is ok.
# optical species index 1 (the opaque part is indexed by using the - sign)
